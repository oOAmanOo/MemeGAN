"""is it possible to order too many sides? this question has confounded foodies for trillions of years or at least since the FYP has become a thing. some folks follow traditional etiquette that says you should only order a single side with your entree. but real #fastfood aficionados who live that #fastfoodlife know a shocking, earth shattering secret...side-orders are more than just side pieces...they are the MAIN CHARACTERS. *cue dramatic music* So what does your side order preference say about you? we consulted with all the top scientists and here's what they told us: Fries - you r classy. you appreciate traditional side-order snacks which have a timeless vibe. u also probably would live in a house made out of fried potatoes if you could. srry thats just a fact.  or you just love fried onions. either #science Cheese Fries - all the same as above except u r a wild and crazy person to whom no rules can realistically be applied and u have tapped into the universal truth that literally everything tastes better with cheese on it. honestly  respect.  Chili Cheese Fries - all the same as the above except u r even wilder and crazier than the cheese fries stans and have tapped into the even more universal truth that literally everything tastes better with cheese AND chili on it. based.  Onion Rings - your attraction to the circular onion ring reflects a oneness with the cyclical nature of all things. like the ring of onion  you are content with the beginning and end of all things existing in harmony at the same moment with each other. that  or. Mozzarella Sticks - better known as """"""""mozz stix"""""""" by their rabid global fanbase. if ur into mozz sticks it means that u - much like the bendy  melty mozz cheese itself - are adaptable  flexible  and able to evolve seamlessly with any situation that todays ever-changing global snackingplace can throw at you.  So there you have it! scientifically proven profiles of the people who call themselves side-order stans. and remember: all this info came from renowned snacking scientists and not the unhinged ramblings of SONICs social media person finally let off their creative leash. Happy side-ordering  to you and yours! """"""",sonicdrivein_176,0
