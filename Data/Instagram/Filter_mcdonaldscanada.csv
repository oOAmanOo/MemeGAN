"Contest Alert! 🚨 After some time away from my run club, I figured it was the right time to get off the couch and back into my running shoes.

To make them forget about all the time I had missed, I wasn’t going to come to the run empty-handed.

I had known that McDonald’s Canada just launched a refreshed McWrap lineup in craveable flavours like Chicken & Bacon, Sweet Chili and Zesty Lime and available in crispy or grilled chicken, so I figured why not share the surprise with them and let them fuel up post run!

Made with 100% Canadian-raised seasoned chicken, the McWrap lineup is an easy option whether you’re on the go or on the run. Also, you can try out the refreshed Chicken Snack Wrap lineup including flavours like Ranch and Spicy Buffalo!

Want to win a McWrap bundle to share with your group? All you need to do is:

1. Follow myself and @mcdonaldscanada 
2. Tag your group mates you’d share with in the comments
3. Reside in Canada, excluding Quebec and 18+ years old
And you could be the one making your group happy!

At the end of the day, it’s great to be back and to stick with running again but the team couldn’t decide on their fave flavour, but I know mine was Sweet Chili. But I wanna know what yours is!?

"A message from John Betts, McDonald’s Canada President & CEO:⁣⁣
⁣
Over the past few weeks, I’ve been inspired by the many ways Canadians are taking care of each other during this extraordinary time. The outpouring of support for frontline workers, the elderly, our neighbours and communities is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It’s these positive and uplifting stories that give me confidence that our future is secure as we work together to overcome this crisis.⁣⁣
⁣
I want to thank our franchisees and restaurant teams across the country for continuing to serve Canadians and supporting their communities in amazing ways. While so much has changed in the last few weeks, it’s reassuring to know that some things are still the same. Our commitment to the communities we serve is unwavering – we’re proud to continue serving Canadians our classic menu at a time when affordability and convenience matter most. This video really sums it up.⁣⁣
⁣
Thank you for making us part of your day, and we look forward to serving you soon.⁣⁣
