You know you are quite a \\n\\ndecorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I \\n\\nlike that boulder. That is a nice boulder.\\n\\n-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?\\n\\n-I like my privacy.\\n\\n-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I \\n\\nhate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them \\n\\na hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.\\n\\n-Can I stay with you?\\n\\n-Uh, what?\\n\\n-Can I stay with you, please?\\n\\n-Of course!\\n\\n-Really?\\n\\n-No.\\n\\n-Please! I don't wanna go back there!

I'm a donkey. I was born outside. \\n\\nI'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know.

Not there. Not there.\\n\\n-Oh!\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-Hey, don't look at me.

Is this not the most perfect \\n\\nkingdom of them all?\\n\\n-Well, technically you're not a king.\\n\\n-Uh, Thelonius.\\n\\n-You were saying?\\n\\n-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All \\n\\nyou have to do is marry a princess.\\n\\n-Go on.\\n\\n{Chuckles}\\n\\n-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to \\n\\nmeet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette \\n\\nnumber one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. \\n\\nShe likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking \\n\\nand cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.\\n\\n-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of \\n\\nfancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just \\n\\nkiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come \\n\\non. Give it up for Snow White!\\n\\n-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a \\n\\nfiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling \\n\\nlava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes \\n\\npina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, \\n\\nPrincess Fiona!\\n\\n-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or \\n\\nbachelorette number three?\\n\\n-Two! Two!\\n\\n-Three! Three!\\n\\n-Two! Two!\\n\\n-Three! \\n\\n-Three? One?\\n\\n{Shudders} Three?\\n\\n--Three! Pick number three, my lord!\\n\\n-Okay, okay, uh, number three!\\n\\n-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you like pina coladas\\n\\nAnd getting caught in the rain\\n\\n\\n\\n-Princess Fiona.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you're not into yoga\\n\\n\\n\\n-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - \\n\\n-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.\\n\\n-I'll do it.\\n\\n-Yes, but after sunset - -\\n\\n-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will \\n\\nfinally have the perfect king!\\n\\nCaptain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.\\n\\n\\n\\n-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd \\n\\nfind it.\\n\\n-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.\\n\\n-Uh-huh. That's the place.\\n\\n-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?\\n\\n{Laughs}\\n\\n{Groans}\\n\\n-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.\\n\\n-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.\\n\\n-Hey, you!\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you.

I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for \\n\\nme, and I'll give you your swamp back.\\n\\n-Exactly the way it was?\\n\\n-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.\\n\\n-And the squatters?\\n\\n-As good as gone.\\n\\n-What kind of quest?\\n\\n-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a \\n\\nprincess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only \\n\\ndon't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.\\n\\n-Is that about right?\\n\\n-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.\\n\\n-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on \\n\\nhim? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make \\n\\nyour bread, the whole orge trip.\\n\\n-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and \\n\\nput their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and \\n\\ndrink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?\\n\\n-Uh, no, not really, no.\\n\\n-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.\\n\\n-Example?\\n\\n-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.\\n\\n-{Sniffs} They stink?\\n\\n-Yes - - No!\\n\\n-They make you cry?\\n\\n-No!\\n\\n-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little \\n\\nwhite hairs.\\n\\n-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have \\n\\nlayers. You get it? We both have layers. \\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes \\n\\nonions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.\\n\\n-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.\\n\\n-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a \\n\\nperson, you say, &quot;Let's get some parfait,&quot; they say, &quot;No, I don't like \\n\\nno parfait&quot;? Parfaits are delicious.\\n\\n-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like \\n\\nonions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.\\n\\n-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.\\n\\n-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or \\n\\nsomething? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start \\n\\nslobbering.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm on my way from misery to happiness today\\n\\nUh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh\\n\\nI'm on my way from misery to happiness today\\n\\nUh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh\\n\\nAnd everything that you receive up yonder\\n\\nIs what you give to me the day I wander\\n\\nI'm on my way \\n\\nI'm on my way \\n\\nI'm on my way \\n\\n\\n\\n-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?\\n\\n-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was \\n\\nopen. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's \\n\\nbrimstone We must be getting close.\\n\\n-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I \\n\\nknow what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone \\n\\nneither.\\n\\n{Rumbling}\\n\\n-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.\\n\\n{Laughing}\\n\\n-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?\\n\\n-Oh, aye.\\n\\n-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have \\n\\nlayers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.\\n\\n-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.\\n\\n-You know what I mean.\\n\\n-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.\\n\\n-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over \\n\\na boiling like of lava!\\n\\n-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional \\n\\nsupport., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step \\n\\nat a time.\\n\\n-Really?\\n\\n-Really, really.\\n\\n-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.\\n\\n-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.\\n\\n-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on \\n\\nmoving. Don't look  down.\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, \\n\\nplease! \\n\\n-But you're already halfway.\\n\\n-But I know that half is safe!\\n\\n-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.\\n\\n-Shrek, no! Wait!\\n\\n-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?\\n\\n-Don't do that!\\n\\n-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?\\n\\n-Oh, this?\\n\\n-Yes, that!\\n\\n-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!\\n\\n-You said do it! I'm doin' it.\\n\\n-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!\\n\\n-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.\\n\\n-Cool.\\n\\n-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?\\n\\n-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.\\n\\n{Chuckles}\\n\\n-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.\\n\\n{Water dripping, wind howling}\\n\\n-You afraid?\\n\\n-No.\\n\\n-But - -\\n\\n- Shh.\\n\\n-Oh, good. Me neither.\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible \\n\\nresponse to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I \\n\\nmight add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and \\n\\nbreathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little \\n\\nscared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if \\n\\nyou can find any stairs.\\n\\n-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.\\n\\n-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest \\n\\ntower.\\n\\n-What makes you think she'll be there?\\n\\n-I read it in a book once.\\n\\n-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those \\n\\nstairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way \\n\\nthey're goin'.\\n\\n{Creacing}\\n\\n-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with \\n\\nme. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a \\n\\nstep right here. I'd step all over it.\\n\\n-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - \\n\\n-Dragon!\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n{Roars}\\n\\n-Donkey, look out!\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n{Whimpering}\\n\\n-Got ya!\\n\\n{Roars}\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n{Shouts}\\n\\n-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\\n\\n{Screaming}\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-Oh! Aah! Aah!\\n\\n{Gasping}\\n\\n{Crowls}\\n\\n-No. Oh, no, No!\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n-Oh, what large teeth you have.\\n\\n{Crowls}\\n\\n-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time \\n\\nfrom your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile \\n\\nyou got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know \\n\\nwhat else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of \\n\\ncourse you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. \\n\\nWhat's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. \\n\\nOh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - \\n\\n(Coughs)\\n\\n-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna \\n\\nblow smoke rings. Shrek!\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n{Whimpering}\\n\\n-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\\n\\n{Groans, Sighs}\\n\\n{Vocalizing}\\n\\n-Oh! Oh!\\n\\n-Wake up!\\n\\n-What?\\n\\n-Are you Princess Fiona?\\n\\n-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.\\n\\n-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!\\n\\n-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be \\n\\na wonderful, romantic moment?\\n\\n-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.\\n\\n-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out \\n\\nyonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.\\n\\n-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?\\n\\n-Mm-hmm.\\n\\n{Screams, grunts}\\n\\n-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for \\n\\nme. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!\\n\\n-I don't think so.\\n\\n-Can I at least know the name of my champion?\\n\\n-Um, Shrek.\\n\\n-Sir Shrek.\\n\\n{Cleans throat}\\n\\n-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.\\n\\n-Thanks!\\n\\n{Roaring}\\n\\n-You didn't slay the dragon?\\n\\n-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, \\n\\nbanner flying. That's what all the other knights did.\\n\\n-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.\\n\\n-That's not the point. Oh!\\n\\n-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.\\n\\n-Well, I have to save my ass.\\n\\n-What kind of knight are you?\\n\\n-One of a kind.\\n\\n-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to \\n\\nknow someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. \\n\\n{Laughs}\\n\\n-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not \\n\\nemotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really \\n\\nis the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted \\n\\nphysical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back \\n\\nup a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to \\n\\nknow each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, \\n\\nbut I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - \\n\\nDon't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna \\n\\ntear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with \\n\\nthat? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!\\n\\n{Growls}\\n\\n{Roaring}\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-Hi, Princess!\\n\\n-It talks!\\n\\n-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n{Screaming}\\n\\n-Oh!\\n\\n{Thuds}\\n\\n{Groans}\\n\\n{Roars}\\n\\n{Roaring}\\n\\n-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.\\n\\n{Fchoing}\\n\\n-Run!\\n\\n{Gasping}\\n\\n{Screaming}\\n\\n{Roaring}\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n{Roars}\\n\\n{Panting, sighs}\\n\\n{Whimpers}\\n\\n{Roars}\\n\\n-You did it!\\n\\n-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. \\n\\nYou're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and \\n\\nthine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. \\n\\n{Clears throat}\\n\\n-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?\\n\\n-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a \\n\\nsteed.\\n\\n-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.\\n\\n-Uh, no.\\n\\n-Why not?\\n\\n-I have helmet hair.\\n\\n-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.\\n\\n-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.\\n\\n-But how will you kiss me?\\n\\n-What? That wasn't in the job description.\\n\\n-Maybe it's a perk.\\n\\n-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in \\n\\na tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then \\n\\nthey share true love's first kiss.\\n\\n-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you \\n\\ntrue love?\\n\\n-Well, yes.\\n\\n{Laughing}\\n\\n-You think Shrek is your true love!\\n\\n-What is so funny?\\n\\n-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?\\n\\n-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your \\n\\nhelmet.\\n\\n-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.\\n\\n-Just take off the helmet.\\n\\n-I'm not going to.\\n\\n-Take ot off.\\n\\n-No!\\n\\n-Now!\\n\\n-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.\\n\\n-You- - You're a- - an orge.\\n\\n-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.\\n\\n-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed \\n\\nto be an orge.\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the \\n\\none who wants to marry you.\\n\\n-Then why didn't he come rescue me?\\n\\n-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.\\n\\n-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - \\n\\nhis pet.\\n\\n-So much for noble steed.\\n\\n-You're not making my job any easier.\\n\\n-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad \\n\\nthat if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right \\n\\nhere.\\n\\n-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.\\n\\n-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!\\n\\n-Ya comin', Donkey?\\n\\n-I'm right behind ya.\\n\\n-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not \\n\\ndignified! Put me down!\\n\\n-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, \\n\\nright, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down \\n\\nreal easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a \\n\\ncrisp and eaten?\\n\\n-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what \\n\\nhappens when you find your - -  Hey!\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.\\n\\n-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!\\n\\n-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?\\n\\n-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in \\n\\nshort supply.\\n\\n{Laughs}\\n\\n-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.\\n\\n-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never \\n\\nmeasure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.\\n\\n-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the \\n\\n&quot;measuring&quot; when you see him tomorrow.\\n\\n-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?\\n\\n-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.\\n\\n-But there's robbers in the woods.\\n\\n-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.\\n\\n-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this \\n\\nforest.\\n\\n-I need to find somewhere to camp now!\\n\\n{Birds wings fluttering}\\n\\n{Grunting}\\n\\n-Hey! Over here.\\n\\n-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a \\n\\nprincess.\\n\\n-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.\\n\\n-Homey touches? Like what?\\n\\n{Crashing}\\n\\n-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.\\n\\n-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.\\n\\n-I said good night!\\n\\n-Shrek, What are you doing?\\n\\n{Laughs}\\n\\n-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.\\n\\n{Fire cracking}\\n\\n-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over \\n\\nthree wheat fields. Right. Yeah.\\n\\n-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?\\n\\n-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, \\n\\nthere's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.\\n\\n-I know you're making this up.\\n\\n-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away \\n\\nfrom his stench.\\n\\n-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.\\n\\n-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? \\n\\nForget it.\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?\\n\\n-Our swamp?\\n\\n-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.\\n\\n-We? Donkey, there's no &quot;we&quot;. There's no &quot;our&quot;. There's just me and my \\n\\nswamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my \\n\\nland.\\n\\n-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what \\n\\nI think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody \\n\\nout.\\n\\n-No, do ya think?\\n\\n-Are you hidin' something?\\n\\n-Never mind, Donkey.\\n\\n-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?\\n\\n-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.\\n\\n-Why don't you want to talk about it?\\n\\n-Why do you want to talk about it?\\n\\n-Why are you blocking?\\n\\n-I'm not blocking.\\n\\n-Oh, yes, you are.\\n\\n-Donkey, I'm warning you.\\n\\n-Who you trying to keep out?\\n\\n-Everyone! Okay?\\n\\n-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.\\n\\n-Oh! For the love of Pete!\\n\\n-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?\\n\\n-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that \\n\\nseems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. \\n\\n&quot;Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!&quot; They judge me before they \\n\\neven know me. That's why I'm better off alone.\\n\\n-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, \\n\\nstupid, ugly orge.\\n\\n-Yeah, I know.\\n\\n-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?\\n\\n-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.\\n\\n-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one \\n\\nthere?\\n\\n-That's the moon.\\n\\n-Oh, okay.\\n\\n\\n\\n{Orchestra}\\n\\n{Dulcimer}\\n\\n-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the \\n\\nprincess.\\n\\n-Hmph.\\n\\n-Ah. Perfect.\\n\\n{Inhales}\\n\\n\\n\\n{Snoring}\\n\\n{Vocalizing}\\n\\n{Whistling}\\n\\n{Sizzling}\\n\\n{Sniffs, yawns}\\n\\n-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.\\n\\n--Come on, baby. I said I like it.\\n\\n-Donkey, wake up.\\n\\n-Huh? What?\\n\\n-Wake up.\\n\\n-What?\\n\\n-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?\\n\\n-Good morning, Princess!\\n\\n-What's all this about?\\n\\n-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to \\n\\nmake it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.\\n\\n-Uh, thanks.\\n\\n{Sniffs}\\n\\n-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.\\n\\n{Belches}\\n\\n-Shrek!\\n\\n-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}\\n\\n-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.\\n\\n{Belches}\\n\\n-Thanks.\\n\\n-She's as nasty as you are.\\n\\n-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.\\n\\n-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.\\n\\n{Vocalizing}\\n\\n\\n\\n-La liberte! Hey!\\n\\n-Princess!\\n\\n{Laughs}\\n\\n-What are you doing?\\n\\n-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from \\n\\nthis green - -\\n\\n{Kissing sounds}\\n\\n-beast.\\n\\n-Hey!\\n\\n-That's my princess! Go find you own!\\n\\n-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?\\n\\n-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!\\n\\n-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry \\n\\nMen. \\n\\n{Laughs}\\n\\n\\n\\n{Accordion}\\n\\nTa, dah, dah, dah, whoo.\\n\\nI steal from the rich and give to the needy.\\n\\nHe takes a wee percentage, \\n\\nBut I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels\\n\\nMan, I'm good\\n\\nWhat a guy, Monsieur Hood\\n\\nBreak it down\\n\\nI like an honest fight\\n\\nand a saucy little maid\\n\\nWhat he's basically saying\\n\\nis he likes to get - - \\n\\nPaid\\n\\nSo\\n\\nWhen an orge in the bush\\n\\ngrabs a lady by the tush\\n\\nThat's bad\\n\\nThat's bad\\n\\nWhen a beauty's with a beast\\n\\nit makes me awfully mad\\n\\nHe's mad\\n\\nHe's really, really mad\\n\\nI'll take my blade and\\n\\nram it through your heart\\n\\nKeep your eyes on me, boys\\n\\n'cause I'm about to start\\n\\n\\n\\n{Grunts, Groans}\\n\\n{Karate Yell}\\n\\n{Merry Men Gasping}\\n\\n{Panting}\\n\\n-Man, that was annoying!\\n\\n-Oh, you little- - \\n\\n{Karate Yell}\\n\\n{Accordion}\\n\\n{Shouting, groaning}\\n\\n{Chuckles}\\n\\n-Uh, shall we?\\n\\n-Hold the phone.\\n\\n{Grunts}\\n\\nOh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?\\n\\n-What?\\n\\n-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?\\n\\n-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these \\n\\nthings in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!\\n\\n-What? Oh, would you look at that?\\n\\n-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.\\n\\n-Why? What's wrong?\\n\\n-Shrek's hurt.\\n\\n-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.\\n\\n-Donkey, I'm okay.\\n\\n-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep \\n\\nyou legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the \\n\\nHeimlich?\\n\\n-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and \\n\\nfind me a blue flower with red thorns.\\n\\n-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. \\n\\nDon't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!\\n\\n-{Both} Donkey!\\n\\n-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.\\n\\n-What are the flowers for?\\n\\n-For getting rid of Donkey.\\n\\n-Ah.\\n\\n-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.\\n\\n-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.\\n\\n-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.\\n\\n-No, it's tender.\\n\\n-Now, hold on.\\n\\n-What you're doing is the opposite of help.\\n\\n-Don't move.\\n\\n-Look, time out.\\n\\n-Would you - - \\n\\n{Grunts}\\n\\n-Okay. What do you propose we do?\\n\\n-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red \\n\\nthorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue \\n\\nflower, red thorns.\\n\\n-Ow!\\n\\n-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!\\n\\n-Ow! Not good.\\n\\n-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.\\n\\n{Grunts}\\n\\n-It's just about - - \\n\\n-Ow! Ohh!\\n\\n-Ahem.\\n\\n-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - \\n\\n-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?\\n\\n-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was \\n\\njust- - Ugh! \\n\\n-Ow!\\n\\n-Hey, what's that?\\n\\n{Nervous chickle}\\n\\n-That's- - Is that blood?\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n{Bird chirping}\\n\\n{Grunts}\\n\\n\\n\\nMy beloved monster and me\\n\\nWe go everywhere together\\n\\nWearin' a raincoat\\n\\nthat has four sleeves\\n\\nGets us through all kinds of weather\\n\\n\\n\\n-Aah!\\n\\n\\n\\nShe will always be the only thing\\n\\nThat comes between me and the awful sting\\n\\nThat comes from living in a world\\n\\nthat's so damn mean\\n\\n{Croaks}\\n\\nOh, oh-oh-oh-oh\\n\\n-Hey!\\n\\nLa-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\\n\\n{Both laughing}\\n\\nLa-la, la-la, la-la\\n\\n\\n\\n-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.\\n\\n-That's DuLoc?\\n\\n-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for \\n\\nsomething,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!\\n\\n-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.\\n\\n-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.\\n\\n{Blubbering}\\n\\n-What?\\n\\n-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. \\n\\n-What are you talking about? I'm fine.\\n\\n-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on \\n\\nyour back. Dead.\\n\\n-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?\\n\\n-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.\\n\\n-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and \\n\\nwhen I turn my head like this, look, \\n\\n{Bones crunch}\\n\\n-Ow! See?\\n\\n-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.\\n\\n-I'll get the firewood.\\n\\n-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any \\n\\ntoes! I think I need a hug.\\n\\n\\n\\n-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?\\n\\n-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.\\n\\n-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.\\n\\n-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I \\n\\nmake a mean weedrat stew.\\n\\n{Chuckling}\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.\\n\\n{Gulps}\\n\\n-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind \\n\\nof stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.\\n\\n{Chuckles}\\n\\n-I'd like that.\\n\\n{Slurps, laughs}\\n\\n\\n\\nSee the pyramids along the Nile\\n\\n\\n\\n-Um, Princess?\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch the sunrise from a tropic isle\\n\\n\\n\\n-Yes, Shrek?\\n\\n-I, um, I was wondering.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust remember, darling all the while\\n\\n\\n\\n-Are you- - \\n\\n\\n\\nYou belong to me\\n\\n\\n\\n{Sighs} \\n\\n-Are you gonna eat that?\\n\\n{Chuckles}\\n\\n-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.\\n\\n-Sunset?\\n\\n-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.\\n\\n-What?\\n\\n-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, \\n\\naren't you?\\n\\n-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.\\n\\n-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until \\n\\n- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.\\n\\n{Shrek sighs}\\n\\n -Good night.\\n\\n -Good night.\\n\\n{Door creaks}\\n\\n-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.\\n\\n-Oh, what are you talkin' about?\\n\\n-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. \\n\\nAnd I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.\\n\\n-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.\\n\\n-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in \\n\\nand tell her how you feel.\\n\\n-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, \\n\\nwell, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a \\n\\nprincess, and I'm - - \\n\\n-An orge?\\n\\n-Yeah. An orge.\\n\\n-Hey, where you goin'?\\n\\n-To get... move firewood.\\n\\n{Sighs} \\n\\n\\n\\n-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?\\n\\n{Wings fluttering}\\n\\n-Princess?\\n\\n{Creaking}\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.\\n\\n{Screams}\\n\\n-Aah!\\n\\n-Oh, no!\\n\\n-No, help!\\n\\n-Shh!\\n\\n-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\\n\\n-No, it's okay. It's okay.\\n\\n-What did you do with the princess?\\n\\n-Donkey, I'm the princess.\\n\\n-Aah!\\n\\n-It's me, in this body.\\n\\n-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?\\n\\n-Donkey!\\n\\n-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!\\n\\n-No!\\n\\n-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\\n\\n-Shh.\\n\\n-Shrek!\\n\\n-This is me.\\n\\n{Muffled mumbling}\\n\\n-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.\\n\\n-I'm ugly, okay?\\n\\n-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats \\n\\nwas a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - \\n\\n-No.\\n\\n-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.\\n\\n-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.\\n\\n-It's only happens when sun goes down.\\n\\n&quot;By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you \\n\\nfind true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form.&quot;\\n\\n-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.\\n\\n-It's a spell.\\n\\n{Sighs} \\n\\n-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I \\n\\nbecome this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to \\n\\nawait the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry \\n\\nLord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.\\n\\n{Sobs}\\n\\n-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not \\n\\nthat ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look \\n\\nlike this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.\\n\\n-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant \\n\\nto look.\\n\\n-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?\\n\\n-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.\\n\\n-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you \\n\\ngot a lot in common.\\n\\n-Shrek?\\n\\n\\n\\n-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for \\n\\nme too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's \\n\\npretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might \\n\\nlike it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - \\n\\n- \\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.\\n\\n-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I \\n\\nmean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? \\n\\n&quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; don't go together. That's why I can't stay here \\n\\nwith Shrek.\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.\\n\\n{Deep sigh}\\n\\n-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only \\n\\nway to break the spell.\\n\\n-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.\\n\\n-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.\\n\\n-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?\\n\\n-Promise you won't tell. Promise!\\n\\n-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know \\n\\nbefore this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.\\n\\n-Look at my eye twitchin'.\\n\\n{Door opens}\\n\\n{Snoring}\\n\\n-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. \\n\\n-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - \\n\\n{Snoring}\\n\\n-Shrek. Are you all right?\\n\\n-Perfect! Never been better.\\n\\n-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.\\n\\n-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last \\n\\nnight.\\n\\n-You heard what I said?\\n\\n-Every word.\\n\\n-I thought you'd understand.\\n\\n-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, &quot;Who could love a hideous, ugly \\n\\nbeast?&quot; \\n\\n-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.\\n\\n-Yeah? Well, it does.\\n\\n{Gasps, sighs}\\n\\n-Ah, right on time.\\n\\n{Horse whinnies}\\n\\n-Princess, I've brought you a little something.\\n\\n{Fanfare}\\n\\n{Yawns}\\n\\n-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?\\n\\n{Muffled}\\n\\n-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.\\n\\n-Princess Fiona.\\n\\n-As promised. Now hand it over.\\n\\n-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.\\n\\n-Take it and go before I change my mind.\\n\\n-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I \\n\\nhave never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.\\n\\n-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.\\n\\n{Snaps fingers}\\n\\n-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.\\n\\n-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the \\n\\norge. It's not like it has feelings.\\n\\n-No, you're right. It doesn't.\\n\\n-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in \\n\\nmarriage.\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?\\n\\n-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - \\n\\n-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!\\n\\n-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun \\n\\nsets.\\n\\n-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's \\n\\nso much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest \\n\\nlist. Captain, round up some guests!\\n\\n-Fare-thee-well, orge.\\n\\n-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.\\n\\n-Yeah? So what?\\n\\n-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to \\n\\nher last night, She's - - \\n\\n-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? \\n\\nNow, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?\\n\\n-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.\\n\\n-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! \\n\\nMy swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, \\n\\npathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!\\n\\n-But I thought - - \\n\\n-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!\\n\\n-Shrek.\\n\\n\\n\\nI heard there was a secret chord\\n\\nThat David played and it pleased the Lord\\n\\nBut you don't really care for music, do ya\\n\\nIt goes like this the fourth, the fifth\\n\\nThe minor fall the major lift\\n\\nThe baffled king composing hallelujah\\n\\nHallelujah,  hallelujah\\n\\nBaby, I've been here before\\n\\nI know this room I've walked this floor\\n\\nI used to live alone before I knew you\\n\\nI've seen your flag on the marble arch\\n\\nBut love is not a victory march\\n\\nIt's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah\\n\\nHallelujah,  hallelujah\\n\\nAnd all I ever learned from love\\n\\nIs how to shoot at someone\\n\\nWho outdrew you\\n\\n{Moaning}\\n\\nAnd it's not a cry you can hear at night\\n\\nIt's not somebody who's seen the light\\n\\nIt's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah\\n\\n{Moaning}\\n\\nHallelujah,  hallelujah\\n\\n\\n\\n{Thumping sound}\\n\\n-Donkey?\\n\\n{Grunts}\\n\\n-What are you doing?\\n\\n-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see \\n\\none.\\n\\n-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not \\n\\nthrough it.\\n\\n-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.\\n\\n-Oh! Your half. Hmm.\\n\\n-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I \\n\\nget half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks \\n\\nlike your head.\\n\\n-Back off!\\n\\n-No, you back off.\\n\\n-This is my swamp!\\n\\n-Our swamp.\\n\\n-Let go, Donkey!\\n\\n-You let go.\\n\\n-Stubborn jackass!\\n\\n-Smelly orge.\\n\\n-Fine!\\n\\n-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.\\n\\n-Well, I'm through with you.\\n\\n-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, &quot;Me, me, me!&quot; Well, guess \\n\\nwhat! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are \\n\\nmean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! \\n\\nYou're always pushing me around or pushing me away.\\n\\n-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?\\n\\n-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!\\n\\n-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in \\n\\nthe back!\\n\\n-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your \\n\\nown feelings.\\n\\n-Go away!\\n\\n-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she \\n\\never do was like you, maybe even love you.\\n\\n-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of \\n\\nyou talking. \\n\\n-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody \\n\\nelse.\\n\\n-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?\\n\\n-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. \\n\\nRight? Right?\\n\\n-Donkey!\\n\\n-No!\\n\\n-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?\\n\\n{Sighs}\\n\\n-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you \\n\\nforgive me?\\n\\n-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?\\n\\n-Right. Friends?\\n\\n-Friends.\\n\\n-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?\\n\\n-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?\\n\\n-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.\\n\\n-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I \\n\\nhave a way.\\n\\n{Whistles}\\n\\n-Donkey?\\n\\n-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.\\n\\n{Laughing}\\n\\n-Aw, come here, you.\\n\\n-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. \\n\\nAll right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install \\n\\nthe seat belts yet.\\n\\n-Whoo!\\n\\n{Bells tolling}\\n\\n{All gasping}\\n\\n-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....\\n\\n-Um-\\n\\n-of our new king - -\\n\\n-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the &quot;I do's&quot;?\\n\\n{Chuckling}\\n\\n-Go on.\\n\\n-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about \\n\\nthat? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't \\n\\nyou?\\n\\n-What are you talking about?\\n\\n-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, &quot;Speak \\n\\nnow or forever hold your peace.&quot; That's when you say, &quot;I object!&quot;\\n\\n-I don't have time for this!\\n\\n-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this \\n\\nwoman, don't you?\\n\\n-Yes.\\n\\n-You wanna hold her?\\n\\n-Yes.\\n\\n-Please her?\\n\\n-Yes!\\n\\n-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that \\n\\nromantic crap!\\n\\n-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?\\n\\n-We gotta check it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n-And so, by the power vested in me, \\n\\n-What do you see?\\n\\n-The whole town's in there.\\n\\n-I now pronounce you husband and wife,\\n\\n-They're at the altar.\\n\\n-king and queen.\\n\\n-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.\\n\\n-Oh, for the love of Pete!\\n\\n{Grunts}\\n\\n-I object!\\n\\n-Shrek?\\n\\n{Gasps}\\n\\n-Oh, now what does he want?\\n\\n-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. \\n\\nVery clean.\\n\\n-What are you doing here?\\n\\n-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but \\n\\nshowing up uninvited to a wedding - -\\n\\n-Fiona! I need to talk to you.\\n\\n-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll \\n\\nexcuse me - - \\n\\n-But you can't marry him.\\n\\n-And why not?\\n\\n-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.\\n\\n-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.\\n\\n-He's not your true love.\\n\\n-And what do you know about true love?\\n\\n-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - \\n\\n-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! \\n\\nOh, good Lord.\\n\\n{Crowd laughting}\\n\\n-An orge and a princess!\\n\\n-Shrek, is this true?\\n\\n-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away \\n\\nfrom our &quot;happily ever after.&quot; Now kiss me! Mmmmm!\\n\\n-&quot;By night one way, by day another.&quot; I wanted to show you before.\\n\\n{Whimpers}\\n\\n{Crown gasping}\\n\\n-Well, uh, that explains a lot.\\n\\n-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of \\n\\nmy sight now! Get them! Get them both!\\n\\n-No, no!\\n\\n-Shrek!\\n\\n-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that \\n\\nmakes me king! See? See?\\n\\n-No, let go of me! Shrek!\\n\\n-No!\\n\\n-Don't just stand there, you morons.\\n\\n-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! \\n\\n-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and \\n\\nquartered!\\n\\n-You'll beg for death to save you!\\n\\n-No, Shrek!\\n\\n-And as for you, my wife,\\n\\n-Fiona!\\n\\n-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!\\n\\n-I'm king!\\n\\n{Whistles}\\n\\n-I will have order!
